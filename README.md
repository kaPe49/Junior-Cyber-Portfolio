# Read Me

This repo is a Junior cybersecurity portfolio where I save notes and write-ups as I learn cyber fundamentals. I mainly use TryHackMe as a learning platform, where I engage in walkthroughs and challenges. I will also include write-ups from future CTFs, such as the NCL.
### Folders
- **Concept Notes**: Has notes about cybersecurity concepts, protocols, and frameworks, such as **Networking**, **IP**, **OSI**, etc.
- **Tool Notes**: Has notes about cybersecurity tools, such as **John The Ripper** or **Burp Suite**. Each tool is sorted in either the **Blue** or **Red** folder depending on the tool's purpose
- **Writeups**: Has writeups from completed challenges and CTFs
